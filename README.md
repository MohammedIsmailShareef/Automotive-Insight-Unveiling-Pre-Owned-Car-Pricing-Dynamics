# Data-Analysis-Project

During phase 1 of this project, the project commenced by using the data source, Car Detail, from Car Dekho which was sourced from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/'>Kaggle</a> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">(Kaggle. (2019). Kaggle: Your Home for Data Science. Kaggle.com.)</a>. This dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho">(dataset link)</a> contains the prices of 4340 used cars that were sold through the online car marketplace CarDekho. Firstly, the data was preprocessed to "clean" it. The dataset was mostly "clean", but it required one change, the name attribute of the table included the name of the car as well the model of the car for each car, so this column "name" was modified so that the model of the car was dropped and only the name of the brand of the car remained, which would later help in identifying underlying trends. Next, the "clean" data was plotted to visualise the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent/target variable which was the selling price of the used car. From the visualisation of the data through graphs, multiple associations were identified; it was found that used cars that had a higher selling price generally had a much more recent year of manufacture, were driven a lower number of kilometers, had a lower number of previous owners and had an automatic transmission. In phase 2 of the project, further analysis was taken in relation to the phase 1 report and multiple linear regression was performed to ultimately predict the selling price of a used car which was impacted by multiple variables.
